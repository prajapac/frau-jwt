# frau-jwt

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
[![Build status][ci-image]][ci-url]

Simple utility to get a json web token in a D2L free range application
([frau](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/frau)).

## Install
```sh
npm install frau-jwt --save
```

## Usage
```js
var jwt = require('frau-jwt');

jwt('a:b:c')
	.then(function (token) {
		// do a thing with the token
	});

```

### API

---

#### `jwt([String scope])` -> `Promise<String>`

Requests a JWT with the given scope from the hosting LMS. If in an ifrau, the
request will be delegated to the frame host. The resulting token will be cached
until it expires.

##### Optional: scope

If _scope_ is provided, then it will be sent as the request scope of the token.
It should be a properly formatted String, with scopes seperated by spaces.
Defaults to `*:*:*`.

###### Examples

* `foo:bar:baz`
* `a:b:c x:y:z`

##### Optional: opts

If an _opts_ object is provided, it will be checked to see if it contains `extendSession` and its value.
Specifically, if `extendSession` is set to `false`, then the parameter `X-D2L-Session: no-keep-alive` is sent as part of the token fetch request body.
This prevents the user session from being extended when the token is refetched.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```
